Housing prices prediction using Machine Learning
 •used python library for reading, clean and transforming data ( Pandas, NumPy and skit-learn)
 •Data Exploration ( Missing values and Categorical values ) using Pandas.
 •transforming categorical data using Simple Imputer , One-Hot Imputer.
 •spliting data for training and testing purpose.
 •Training Machine Learning model on algorithms such as Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. 
 •Prediction of data and Model validation by metrics such Mean Absolute Error ( MEA ).
 •Cross-Validation of Model using different sections of training data
